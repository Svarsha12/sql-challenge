## BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Created a project sql-challenge and inside the repository created a folder name EmployeeSQL

## Instructions

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling

Inspected csv files and sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, I used a tool QuickDBD

I added ERD diagram ERD.jpeg and QuickDBD Free diagram.sql to the repository.

## Data Engineering

I used the provided information to created a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
I specified the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
For the primary keys, I verified that the column is unique.
Created the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

I created the table abnd added the sql script to sql_table.sql file.


##  Data Analysis

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)

I analysed data and added the sql_query script to the repository(sql_query.sql file).

## Hints and Help

I went through a sql class materials and used postgres sql documentation and took little help of xpertlearning tool.
